## 更新日志 Changelog    
# version 2.3    
在程序主页面添加了“帮助”与“打开对应网站”的按钮，提高了程序稳定性，修复了部分漏洞，添加了程序图标。    
We have incorporated "Help" and "Open Corresponding Website" buttons on the main interface, which not only enhance the stability of the program but also address certain vulnerabilities that were identified. Additionally, a program icon has been included to further enhance the visual appeal.    
# version 2.2
修复了程序运行结束后会在后台静默运行的bug。还改进了保存文件提示框的一个小细节。	   
The bug that caused the program to continue running in the background after it has completed has been fixed.. Additionally, a minor detail regarding the save file prompt has been improved.    
# version 2.1      
优化了使用体验，调用了文件资源管理器来选择PDF文件的路径，也为后续的另一个分支做准备  
We have further improved the user experience by implementing "explorer" to select the path for the PDF file. This enhancement also sets the stage for a potential future branch of development.
# version 2.0     
优化了使用体验，用户交互界面从命令行窗口改为了基于Tkinker的对话框，省去了使用后需要手动删除“images”文件夹的步骤，PDF文件改为在与程序同一路径生成  
We have enhanced the user experience by transitioning from a command-line interface to a dialog box based on Tkinter. This eliminates the need for manually deleting the "images" folder after usage. Additionally, PDF files are now generated in the same directory as the program itself for added convenience.    
# version 1.0  
本python项目基于requests、Pillow等库，可以自动下载图片文件并生成PDF文件，使用后需删除“images”文件夹内所有的图片文件  
This Python project is built upon libraries such as requests and Pillow. It has the capability to automatically download image files and generate PDF files. However, it is important to note that after usage, all image files within the "images" folder should be deleted manually.
